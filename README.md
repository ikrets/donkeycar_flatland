# donkeycar_flatland
The end goal of this repo would be a donkeycar model plugin and a sensor plugin, simulating lane data extracted from camera, successfully used in a SLAM algorithm on cyclic track, given high odometry noise. Or alternatively a realization that SLAM will not perform well in this situation.
